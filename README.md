# F1 Dash

This is a website that I created for Formula 1 fans. It has basics features as for now, but I plan to add more in the future.
If you look deeper, you'll see that I am currently working on my own API to get the data from it. I will update this repo when it's done.

## Why did I create this?

I always loved Formula 1 and wanted to create a website on it. 

## How does it work?

I am pretty sure that you know how to use a website. Just click on the buttons and you will see the magic happen.

## Why an API?

I wanted to create an API in the format I wanted. I also wanted to learn how to create a REST API and how to use it.

## How to use it?

You can use it by cloning the repository and opening the `index.php` file in your browser. You can also access it online [here](https://didoub74.hackclub.app/).

## What's next?

I plan to create news pages (there are some files that aren't yet visible).
## License

Do whatever you want with this code. It's free and open source. No restrictions. Just have fun and maybe credit me if you use it (that's not even required but still appreciated).
